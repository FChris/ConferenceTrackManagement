/**
 * This conference class builds a list of tracks from a given list of talks.
 * <p>
 * The conference class assigns talks to tracks and builds the list of tracks such that
 * each talk finds a slot. The primary objective is to accommodate each talk while trying to fill each track
 * as much as possible. There may be sessions which are not optimally filled, if the talk durations do not allow it.
 * During this process talks are assigned start times when they are added to a session in a track.
 * <p>
 * The underlying problem of assigning talks to tracks in a conference is similar to the bin packing problem, where
 * the sessions in the tracks represent bins and the talks represent the items to be packed.
 * The chosen algorithm corresponds to the First-fit-decreasing algorithm.
 * The algorithm works as follows:
 * <p>
 *     <ol>
 *     <li>Sort the list of talks in descending order (longest first)</li>
 *     <li>Create an empty track</li>
 *     <li>Place an item into the first track it fits
 *      <ol>
 *          <li>If the talk does not fit into any track, create a new track and add the talk to it</li>
 *          <li>If a new track was created, add it to the list of tracks</li>
 *      </ol>
 *      </li>
 *      <li>Repeat Step 3 until every item is assigned</li>
 *      <li>Return the list of tracks</li>
 *     </ol>
 * </p>
